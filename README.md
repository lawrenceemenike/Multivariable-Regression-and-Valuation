# Multivariable Regression and Valuation Model

This project focuses on building a multivariable regression model to estimate property prices based on various characteristics. The model is applied to a dataset from Boston, Massachusetts, and considers factors such as the number of rooms, proximity to employment centers, socioeconomic status, and more.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we walk through the steps of developing a regression model that can provide price estimates for residential properties. The process includes:

1. **Data Analysis and Exploration**: Understanding the dataset and exploring the relationships between different variables and the target variable (property prices).
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
3. **Model Development**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, running a multivariable linear regression, and evaluating the model's performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's coefficients and residuals to understand its accuracy and making adjustments through data transformation to improve performance.
5. **Final Predictions**: Using the trained model to estimate property prices based on the given characteristics.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive plotting.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For model building and evaluation.

## How to Use

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure all necessary libraries are installed. If you're using Google Colab, you may need to upgrade certain packages like Plotly.
2. **Load the Data**: The dataset used is loaded and the first column, which contains row numbers, is set as the index.
3. **Run the Cells**: The notebook is organized sequentially; run each cell to see the results of data analysis, model building, and final predictions.

## Key Insights

- The relationship between the number of rooms and property prices was one of the strongest predictors in the model.
- Data transformations were necessary to improve model accuracy, highlighting the importance of preprocessing in regression analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building a multivariable regression model for property price estimation. Through careful data exploration, model development, and evaluation, we were able to create a tool that can provide valuable insights and price predictions based on property characteristics.
